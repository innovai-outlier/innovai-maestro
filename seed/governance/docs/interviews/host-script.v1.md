# Interview Host Script v1 (SpecKit Intake ETL)

Use this to run calls and generate clean inputs for Spec Kit artifacts.

## Setup (30s)
- Goal: extract requirements and constraints; avoid implementation discussion.
- Capture notes in three buckets: Facts / Assumptions / Open Questions.

## 1) Context & Why
1. What problem are we solving, and for whom?
2. What happens today (current workflow), and what hurts most?
3. What does success look like, and how will we measure it?

## 2) Users & Scenarios
4. What are the user types/personas involved (and what permissions differ)?
5. Walk me through the top 3 user journeys end-to-end.
6. What is the one thing users must be able to do on day 1?

## 3) Scope Boundaries
7. What is explicitly in scope for v1?
8. What is explicitly out of scope for v1 (even if tempting)?
9. What are the must-haves vs nice-to-haves?

## 4) Inputs, Data, Integrations
10. What data comes in, from where, and in what format?
11. What systems must we integrate with?
12. What data must be stored vs transient, and for how long?

## 5) Rules, Edge Cases, Failures
13. What business rules must always hold true?
14. What are the top edge cases (weird but likely)?
15. What should happen on failures (timeouts, invalid inputs, partial completion)?

## 6) Constraints & Compliance
16. What are the deadlines, budget constraints, and team size for v1?
17. What stack choices are preferred, and what is non-negotiable?
18. What compliance/security requirements apply (LGPD, audit, retention, access controls)?

## 7) Validation & Approval
19. What are the acceptance criteria (objective pass/fail)?
20. What must be tested automatically vs manually, and who owns validation?
21. Who signs off, and what is the approval process?

## 2-minute Readback (mandatory)
- Goal
- In scope v1
- Out of scope v1
- Top journeys
- Acceptance criteria
- Constraints/compliance
- Open questions (block planning until resolved)
